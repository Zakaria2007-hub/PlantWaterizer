This list is what I used to create the waterizer based on what I had in the parts drawers.  There are options of course.

Circuit Board: 

copper strip board: 73mm x 100mm  ( one of the standard sizes, despite the 73mm dimension )
ESP32-S3-N8R2 DevkitC1.   Note: this board is overkill for the device  and the footprint in the schematic doesn't directly match the stripboard layout (the ADC pins are a little off )
3 x 330R resistors
5 x IRLB8721 N-Channel MOSFETs
3 x 5mm LEDs ( Red, Blue , Green )

Misc 2.54 header pins for connectivity off-board
Power header terminal for connecting power to board.

Sensors and pumps: 

5x Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V2 ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094J8XD83 )
5x Submersible pumps ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N47M0KW ). These are low power and cheap.  The head of water is not great though it's good enough for my needs

Either:
1x uxcell ZP4510 float switch 

OR

1x CQRobot Capacitive liquid level sensor ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FL22MJKX ). I use this.  It requires power but otherwise connects to the same pins as a float switch and is either on or off. It can be tuned for sensitivity. 
The float switch will need a mount to keep it at the right depth in the bucket. This CQRobot sensor just needs to be stuck on the outside of the bucket at the right depth. Far nicer, but also 5x the price. 

Connection hardware and casing is up to you.   For reference only: 

Sensor connectors: 6x GX12 12mm 4 pin Aviation connectors  ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M5SLS3P) 
Pump connectors: 5x  24AEWG USB2.0 Pigtail Type A female  ( The pumps are USB-A terminated )
Input power:  USB-C female pigtail ( I originally planned to put a PSU in the case but simplified the design
LED Bezels to suit ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0974DL4QR )
Power switch to suit ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095P1LGR3 )
Case fixing hardware to suit.  I tend to use M3 bolts with brass hot-push inserts.
